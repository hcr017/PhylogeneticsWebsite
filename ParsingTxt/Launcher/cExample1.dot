// COMMENT: Pre-processing the input file to count the leaves
// COMMENT: Pre-processing showed that there are 9 leaves in the input.
// SUMMARY: Input had 9 leaves.
// USER-SETTING: Will *not* post-process output to collapse edges.
// COMMENT: Triplet set is already dense.
// SUMMARY: There are 119 triplets in the input.
// SUMMARY: Total weight of input triplets is 119.
// COMMENT: We achieved non-trivial local perfection.
// SUMMARY: (Before post-processing)
// SUMMARY: We got 96 units of triplet weight, that's 80.67% of total weight.
// SUMMARY: In total 23 units of triplet weight were -not- consistent with the ouput network.
// SUMMARY: Output network contained 34 triplets -not- in the original input.
// SUMMARY: The symmetric difference is thus 23 + (1 * 34) = 57
// SUMMARY: (After post-processing)

// SUMMARY: eNewick output: ((((((((2)#H1,1),(3,#H1)))#H2,4),5),8),(6,(7,(9,#H2))));
// SUMMARY: In total 23 units of triplet weight were -not- consistent with the ouput network.
// SUMMARY: Output network contained 34 triplets -not- in the original input.
// SUMMARY: Weight of missing triplets before contraction minus weight of missing triplets afterwards: 0
// SUMMARY: Number of surplus triplets before contraction minus number of surplus triplets afterwards: 0
// CONCLUSION: After post-processing we got 96 units of triplet weight, that's 80.67% of total weight (before post-processing this was 80.67%).
// CONCLUSION: After post-processing the symmetric difference is thus 23 + (1 * 34) = 57 (before post-processing this was 57)
// STAT: PERCENTAGE = 80.67
// STAT: NETWORK-TRIPLET SD = 57
