// COMMENT: Pre-processing the input file to count the leaves
// COMMENT: Pre-processing showed that there are 5 leaves in the input.
// SUMMARY: Input had 5 leaves.
// USER-SETTING: Will *not* post-process output to collapse edges.
// COMMENT: Triplet set is already dense.
// SUMMARY: There are 12 triplets in the input.
// SUMMARY: Total weight of input triplets is 12.
// COMMENT: We achieved non-trivial local perfection.
// SUMMARY: (Before post-processing)
// SUMMARY: We got 12 units of triplet weight, that's 100.0% of total weight.
// SUMMARY: In total 0 units of triplet weight were -not- consistent with the ouput network.
// SUMMARY: Output network contained 0 triplets -not- in the original input.
// SUMMARY: The symmetric difference is thus 0 + (1 * 0) = 0
// SUMMARY: (After post-processing)

// SUMMARY: eNewick output: ((((3)#H1,4),((1,2),#H1)),5);
// SUMMARY: In total 0 units of triplet weight were -not- consistent with the ouput network.
// SUMMARY: Output network contained 0 triplets -not- in the original input.
// SUMMARY: Weight of missing triplets before contraction minus weight of missing triplets afterwards: 0
// SUMMARY: Number of surplus triplets before contraction minus number of surplus triplets afterwards: 0
// CONCLUSION: After post-processing we got 12 units of triplet weight, that's 100.0% of total weight (before post-processing this was 100.0%).
// CONCLUSION: After post-processing the symmetric difference is thus 0 + (1 * 0) = 0 (before post-processing this was 0)
// STAT: PERCENTAGE = 100.0
// STAT: NETWORK-TRIPLET SD = 0
