// COMMENT: Pre-processing the input file to count the leaves
// COMMENT: Pre-processing showed that there are 5 leaves in the input.
// SUMMARY: Input had 5 leaves.
// USER-SETTING: Will *not* post-process output to collapse edges.
// COMMENT: Not a dense input set.
// COMMENT: Currently 11 triplets in the input, padding it with 0-weight triplets to make a dense set.
// SUMMARY: There are 13 triplets in the input.
// SUMMARY: (Some of these will be 0-weight triplets that I added).
// SUMMARY: Total weight of input triplets is 11.
// SUMMARY: (Before post-processing)
// SUMMARY: We got 10 units of triplet weight, that's 90.9% of total weight.
// SUMMARY: In total 1 units of triplet weight were -not- consistent with the ouput network.
// SUMMARY: Output network contained 6 triplets -not- in the original input.
// SUMMARY: The symmetric difference is thus 1 + (1 * 6) = 7
// SUMMARY: (After post-processing)

// SUMMARY: eNewick output: ((((2,6))#H1,5),(4,(3,#H1)));
// SUMMARY: In total 1 units of triplet weight were -not- consistent with the ouput network.
// SUMMARY: Output network contained 6 triplets -not- in the original input.
// SUMMARY: Weight of missing triplets before contraction minus weight of missing triplets afterwards: 0
// SUMMARY: Number of surplus triplets before contraction minus number of surplus triplets afterwards: 0
// CONCLUSION: After post-processing we got 10 units of triplet weight, that's 90.9% of total weight (before post-processing this was 90.9%).
// CONCLUSION: After post-processing the symmetric difference is thus 1 + (1 * 6) = 7 (before post-processing this was 7)
// STAT: PERCENTAGE = 90.9
// STAT: NETWORK-TRIPLET SD = 7
